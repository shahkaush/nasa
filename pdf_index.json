During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The<br>venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred<br>to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have<br>remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses<br>of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identiﬁed 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, in-<br>fection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional<br>proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome.</p>",

Kimbrell Received: 23 September 2010 / Accepted: 20 December 2010 / Published online: 30 January 2011 \u0002 The Author(s) 2011. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that par- ticipates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difﬁcult to study in higher organisms.

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Background Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and ﬁsh oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveil- lance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or ﬁsh oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reﬂecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and inﬂammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double- blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression proﬁles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day ﬁsh oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapen- taenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo. Results Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to ﬁsh, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo...</p>",

Hammond1,2,3 · Patricia L. Allen1 · Margaret A. Gunter4 · Jennifer Chiang5 · Guri Giaever5 · Corey Nislow5 · Holly H. Birdsall3,6,7 Abstract Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10+mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear- response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes...</p>",

Spaceﬂight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA ﬁbers commonly observed with spaceﬂight as these ﬁbers are particularly enriched with GSK3.

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE<br>Open Access<br>TNO1, a TGN-localized SNARE-interacting<br>protein, modulates root skewing in<br>Arabidopsis thaliana<br>Rahul Roy1,2,4 and Diane C. Bassham1,2,3*<br>Abstract<br>Background: The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment<br>and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing<br>external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted,<br>impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these<br>phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi<br>network-localized protein in root skewing. Results: We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering<br>factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root<br>skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is<br>insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in<br>tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell<br>file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. Conclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules<br>but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays.</p>",

Sng1, Anna-Lisa Paul1 and Robert J. Ferl1,2*<br>Abstract<br>Background: Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce<br>root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics<br>guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing<br>and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and<br>Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing. Results: This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that<br>differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted<br>growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes<br>are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization,<br>and hormone signaling.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability Wooseong Kim1,2, Farah K Tengra1,2, Jasmine Shong1,2, Nicholas Marchand1,2, Hon Kit Chan1,2, Zachary Young1, Ravindra C Pangule1,2,3, Macarena Parra4, Jonathan S Dordick1,2,5, Joel L Plawsky1 and Cynthia H Collins1,2,5* Abstract Background: Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses. Results: Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability.

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE<br>Open Access<br>5AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have overlapping<br>functions in pollen development and pollen<br>tube growth<br>Jianling Peng, Hilal Ilarslan, Eve Syrkin Wurtele, Diane C Bassham*<br>Abstract<br>Background: Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis,<br>endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been<br>functionally characterized. Results: Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination<br>and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared<br>with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable<br>from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched<br>pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the<br>pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both<br>highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies. Conclusions: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking<br>during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.</p>",

Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic<br>acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen<br>species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the<br>cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been<br>debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a ﬂavonol-<br>speciﬁc dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a ﬂavonol biosynthetic<br>enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-speciﬁc ﬂavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected<br>using a ﬂuorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore<br>synthesizes no ﬂavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type,<br>suggesting that ﬂavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access The role of FGF-2 and BMP-2 in regulation of gene induction, cell proliferation and mineralization Millie Hughes-Fulford1,2,3,4*, Chai-Fei Li4 Abstract Introduction: The difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after severe fracture can result in loss of ambulation or limb. Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone. Materials and methods: The regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization. Results: Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFb, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 (egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (cox-2), tgfb and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1. We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline phosphatase (alp). In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated...</p>",

Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats. Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clus­ ters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand- receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion...</p>",

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only<br>the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to<br>contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling,<br>namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our<br>previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether<br>additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan. Methods: We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12<br>myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG-/-) mice. All<br>were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting<br>of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining<br>muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution.

This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Research Article 2763 Introduction Within eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999; Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994; Mosley- Bishop et al., 1999; Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005; Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes. Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC- Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Starr and Fischer, 2005; Crisp et al., 2006; Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006; Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002; Hodzic et al., 2004; King et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002; Zhang et al.,...</p>",

Costes, PhD3,4 1Universities Space Research Association; 2KBRwyle; 3NASA 4NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA Abstract Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass 0- 21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility. Introduction Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data.

Singh3, Jason M. Wood3, Elena Gaudioso4, Félix Hernández‑del‑Olmo4, Christopher E. Mason5,6,7,8, Kasthuri Venkateswaran3† and Afshin Beheshti9,10† Abstract Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results: We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including...</p>",

The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epi- genome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceﬂight conﬁrms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identiﬁes a mitochondrial DNA-enriched frac- tion associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artiﬁcial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses. A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceﬂight will be important to develop countermeasures for long- term space exploration1. Without effective solutions for aerospace health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel.

In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations. It has been over 50 years since the ﬁrst human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceﬂights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the deﬁnition of commercial spaceﬂight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large- scale investment from governments, and continued public interest.

To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceﬂight on the skin, we con- ducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) ﬂight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™Digital Spatial Proﬁler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-ﬂight samples showed sig- niﬁcant up-regulation of genes related to inﬂammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceﬂight-associated changes mapped to spe- ciﬁc cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints.

Carnell Check for updates With precious few spaceﬂight missions, all space-related biological and biomedical-health data are priceless national resources that anyone should be able to easily access. The NASA Open Science Data Reposi- tory (OSDR: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) plays a crucial role in ensuring such accessibility, housing comprehensive space-related datasets derived not only from various model organisms but also from non- NASA human astronauts1. These datasets cover a wide spectrum of biological assays conducted at multiple levels, ranging across cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. They effectively capture diverse types of data, including ‘omics, phenotypic, physiological, and beha- vioral changes experienced in space2,3. Additionally, OSDR enriches this data by providing metadata contextualizing each experiment including the associated experimental hardware and environmental telemetry. OSDR has worked with a large and open scientiﬁc com- munity to standardize data generation and formatting, enabling advanced analytics, including the use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) for data analysis. With the support of NASA’s scientiﬁc leadership, the spirit of Open Science has permeated every scientiﬁc division at NASA, including the Biological and Physical Science (BPS) Division. The BPS Division has emerged as a pivotal force in fueling humanity’s fascina- tion with space exploration by understanding the mechanisms of life adapting to extreme environmental hazards of deep space4. As NASA launched the ambitious \"Transform to Open Science\" program (TOPS)5 in 2023, it aims to accelerate the adoption of...</p>",

Biospecimen samples were col- lected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceﬂight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA ﬁlter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking.

Costes 2 & Stefania Giacomello 1 Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a signiﬁcant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceﬂight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceﬂight-exposed animals revealed signiﬁcant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the path- way level, some spaceﬂight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceﬂight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for com- parison in future spaceﬂight studies. For broader scientiﬁc impact, all datasets from this study are available through an...</p>",

Here, our genetic screening of the previously con- structed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identiﬁes a glutathione (GSH)- deﬁcient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously deﬁned wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but dis- harmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our ﬁndings offer new insights into highly sophis- ticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against her- bivory and pathogen invasion. Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian ner- vous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, nor- epinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then acti- vate ion channels, and consequently produce ion ﬂux1, thereby indu- cing membrane potential changes...</p>",

Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE- INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2- OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufﬁcient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the...</p>",

Brereton 24 The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceﬂight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceﬂight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed signiﬁcant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceﬂight pathology and that these interactions might critically inﬂuence human health and long-duration spaceﬂight feasibility.

Ronca1,2, Richard C. Mains3, Mark J. Shelhamer4, Jeffrey D. Smith1 and Thomas J. Goodwin5 NASA’s Space Biology and Human Research Program entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and externally to coordinate the agency’s translational research efforts. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at NASA, provide recent examples of NASA sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for a path forward. Our overall objective is to help in stimulating a collaborative research across multiple disciplines and entities that, working together, will more effectively and more rapidly achieve NASA’s goals for human spaceﬂight. npj Microgravity (2017) 3:5 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-016-0002-8 INTRODUCTION With the International Space Station (ISS) available for research and habitation for the next decade, there is now a precious opportunity to signiﬁcantly advance the contributions of space life sciences and space medicine toward enabling the Exploration Class missions (that is, human missions beyond low-Earth orbit). Such missions are currently burdened with signiﬁcant anticipated crew health and safety challenges.1 Coordinated research and development are crucial for producing effective countermeasures against the deleterious inﬂuences of spaceﬂight on the human body. To this end, we emphatically support the development of translational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi- directional information ﬂow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate countermeasure development.

Martinez1, Ivan Silva1, Carla V. Hoehn2, Stephanie Countryman2, Leonard Bailey3, Nahidh Hasaniya3, Michael J. Pecaut 4 and Mary Kearns-Jonker1 The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was signiﬁcantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration.

Bhattaru3, Gary Ruvkun2 and Maria T. Zuber1 Parabolic ﬂights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic ﬂights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration proﬁles and processing methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic ﬂights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F ﬂight with 20 parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classiﬁcation of all phases of ﬂight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic ﬂight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities. npj Microgravity (2018) 4:14 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-018-0050-3 INTRODUCTION Parabolic ﬂights are cost-effective, ground-based analogs that achieve variable g (Earth-relative GIA) level environments that recreate conditions experienced during space ﬂight.1,2 Specialized aircraft can maintain approximately 20–30 s of a 0 g, freefall environment before an increased GIA recovery phase (Fig. 1a).

Brad Barbazuk1,2,3,4, Anna-Lisa Paul 1,5 and Robert J. Ferl 1,2,5 Plants grown in spaceﬂight experience novel environmental signals, including those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceﬂight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceﬂight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceﬂight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceﬂight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceﬂight experiment that was collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceﬂight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceﬂight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of signiﬁcant differential alternative splicing. This study provides the ﬁrst evidence of a role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological adaptation to the spaceﬂight environment. npj Microgravity (2019) 5:9 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-019-0070-7 INTRODUCTION During growth on the International Space Station (ISS), plants encounter a suite of abiotic stressors largely owing to the effects of microgravity, cosmic radiation, and other less-characterized stresses associated with the spaceﬂight environment.

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by spaceﬂight and ground-based spaceﬂight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was signiﬁcantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-ﬂown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type ﬂies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared ﬂies infected with space-ﬂown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceﬂight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results...</p>",

Vroom 1, Yaneli Rodriguez-Ocasio 1, Jonathan B. Lynch 2,3, Edward G. Ruby 2 and Jamie S. Foster 1✉ Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio ﬁscheri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. ﬁscheri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to ﬂagellar motility. Mutants of V. ﬁscheri defective in the production and rotation of their ﬂagella show signiﬁcant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer- membrane integrity of V. ﬁscheri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell- membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceﬂight. npj Microgravity...</p>",

Foster 1✉ Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio ﬁscheri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. ﬁscheri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to ﬂagellar motility. Mutants of V. ﬁscheri defective in the production and rotation of their ﬂagella show signiﬁcant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer- membrane integrity of V. ﬁscheri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell- membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceﬂight. npj Microgravity...</p>",

Choi2, Joseph S. Tash1, April E. Ronca3,4, Joshua S. Alwood 3 and Lane K. Christenson 1✉ Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceﬂight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceﬂight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were exposed to and sacriﬁced on-orbit after 37 days of spaceﬂight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preﬂight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacriﬁce and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was ﬁxed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and ﬂight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and ﬂight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple...</p>",

Costes 2, Jack Miller3,4, Samrawit G. Gebre4, Jonathan Lombardino5 and Simon Gilroy 1✉ In addition to microgravity, spaceﬂight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that signiﬁcantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards deﬁning how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceﬂight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceﬂight. npj Microgravity (2021) 7:15 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00143-x INTRODUCTION The space environment introduces organisms to a unique range of challenges. For example, for humans the closed environment of space vehicles alongside enforced conﬁnement, and the isolation inherent in the vast distances traveled all have important impacts on the functioning of the crew’s physiology and psychology (Fig. 1).

To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceﬂight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing signiﬁcant differential expression in spaceﬂight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to deﬁne plant reactions to spaceﬂight.

Bucher3, P. zu Eulenburg 4, P. Denise 5, N. Smith 6, F. Pagnini 7 and O. White 8✉ Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identiﬁes critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceﬂight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-speciﬁc countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceﬂight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the population on Earth. npj Microgravity (2023)...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: proof of concept Khaled Y. Kamal 1✉, Mariam Atef Othman 1, Joo-Hyun Kim1 and John M. Lawler1,2 Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceﬂight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceﬂight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased signiﬁcantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inﬂammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were signiﬁcantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was signiﬁcantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling...</p>",

Adamopoulos1,2, Lauren M. Sanders 2,3 & Sylvain V. Costes 3 One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceﬂight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceﬂight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis ﬁndings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identiﬁed as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be signiﬁcantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples. NASA GeneLab platform, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) constitutes an omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,...</p>",

Mason 4,5,7 & Sylvain V. Costes 1 The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning ﬁeld of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology. The increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceﬂight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human...</p>",

Braun 1,2 & Val A. Fajardo 1,2 Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause signiﬁcant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-ﬂown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and signiﬁcantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we ﬁnd that spaceﬂight induces signiﬁcant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot...</p>",

The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re- measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis...</p>",

Saravia-Butler5, Gary Hardiman 4, Deanne Taylor 2, Jonathan M. Galazka6 & Sylvain V. Costes 6* Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA- sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be...</p>",

Choi1, Amanda Saravia-Butler2, Yasaman Shirazi-Fard3, Dennis Leveson-Gower1, Louis S. Stodieck4, Samuel M. Cadena5, Janet Beegle3, Stephanie Solis6, April Ronca3,7 & Ruth K. Globus3* Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.

Dillon1, Samantha M. Waters2,7, Garrett T. Graham3, Nicholas A. Be1, Patrick Nicoll4, Sonali Verma5, Tristan Caro6 & David J. Smith7 To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 40,000 ft. Culture- based detections also identified viable Bacillus zhangzhouensis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor global bioaerosol emissions and impacts. Aerosols (mostly desert dust,...</p>",

Hoadley 3, S. Robin Elgart 4, Xiao W. Mao 5 & Parastou Eslami 6 The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post- exposure stages.

Anhydrobiotic animals undergo <br>biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress <br>is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus <br>spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in <br>anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree <br>of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated <br>by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery <br>of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised <br>survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation <br>tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these <br>molecules play roles during rehydration.</p>",

W. A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 & Giovanna Aronne 1 Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying...</p>",

Haines 4, Ashleigh Bope 1,2,3, Marit E. Meyer 5, John M. Horack 6 & Karen C. Dannemiller 2,3,7* Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human- occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: ­R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support...</p>",

However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes.

Eighteen mice were divided into three <br>groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain <br>transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed <br>decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain <br>transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying <br>microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional <br>changes in space.

Mason 5,6 & Susan M. Bailey 1,2 Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation- induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronautsin the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a speciﬁc TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-speciﬁc DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inﬂammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can...</p>",

Reilly2, Zeina Barghouti<br>3, Benedetto Marelli<br>4, Jeffrey C. Way1,2 &<br>Pamela A. Silver<br>1,2<br>Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a<br>unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-speciﬁc intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are<br>often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress<br>adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins<br>termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect<br>diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes<br>from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular<br>application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by<br>which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water<br>and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. These<br>results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for preservation<br>of cells. Water is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several<br>organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost com-<br>plete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2.

    "summary": "<p>1 of 10 The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has become a standard for vegetation and crop health assessment. NDVI, and NDVI-­like methods, have been used for decades by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observatory to monitor global vegetation health (Rouse et al., 1973; Tucker and Choudhury, 1987). More recently, NDVI has been adapted for use in fields and greenhouses growing crops under natural sunlight (re- viewed in Yengoh et al., 2014). Indoor farming is being increasingly relied upon to grow crops in unfavorable environments such as ur- ban areas, areas of extreme temperature, and eventually to support the expansion of human life off-­planet. Because of the completely closed environment of an indoor farm, the early and rapid correc- tion of abiotic stressors such as salt imbalance, low water content, nitrate concentration, and high pH is essential to maintaining plant health and advancing indoor farming applications. Traditional NDVI technology is not ideal for use in indoor farming scenarios because growing crops indoors relies upon fully controlled, artificial lighting for plant growth (Specht et al., 2014). Traditional artificial light sources used to grow crops in controlled conditions focus on optimizing photosynthesis. The use of artificial lighting containing near-­infrared (NIR) wavelengths enables NDVI-­like evaluations of plants in closed environments. This article demonstrates that NDVI analysis in controlled container environments is an applicable and useful tool in plant health monitoring. Controlled plant stress assays are used to validate the ability of modified NDVI imaging to detect evidence of stress before...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>1 of 10 Spaceflight experiments often come with novel challenges com- pared to terrestrial projects, and chief among these are the strin- gent limits to the amount of material that can be launched (small sample size) and restricted on orbit resources (e.g., limited space or duration in growth habitats, limited crew time). These limita- tions often lead to constrained scientific return from those mate- rials, making it particularly important to obtain maximum data from each sample. The primary focus of our research program is the evaluation of the complex responses of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. to the spaceflight environment. Plant root growth in microgravity exhibits skewing and waving behavior (Paul et al., 2012a), insightful patterns of phytohormone distribution in the primary root tips (Ferl and Paul, 2016), and distinct patterns of gene expression and protein utilization (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Ferl et al., 2015). Recent studies have focused on the root apex, with its crucial role in root growth and morphogenesis, guided by the apex’s sensitivity to environmental factors such as gravity, light, and nutrients. Root apexes and their importance In their book The Power of Movement in Plants, Charles and Francis Darwin describe the root apex (the 1.0–1.5-­mm region from the root tip) as the most sensitive zone of the root and refer to the apex as a diffuse brain-­like organ having the sensitivity and ability to direct the movements of adjoining parts (Darwin and Darwin, 1880).

Limoli2 Abstract Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses ( < 1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after ( < 1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion ﬂuences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufﬁcient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a signiﬁcant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to signiﬁcantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and ﬂuences of charged particles can elicit a persisting...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Spaceﬂight Induces Speciﬁc Alterations in the Proteomes of Arabidopsis Robert J. Ferl,1,2 Jin Koh,2 Fiona Denison,1 and Anna-Lisa Paul1 Abstract Life in spaceﬂight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identiﬁed over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantiﬁcation revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically signiﬁcant differential abundance in the spaceﬂight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceﬂight and that the responses are organ- speciﬁc. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceﬂight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceﬂight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceﬂight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

To contribute to the understanding<br>of how plants respond to spaceﬂight stress, we examined the signiﬁcance of the unfolded protein response<br>(UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the<br>model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome proﬁling in<br>wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space<br>Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes<br>compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the<br>ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceﬂight condition. Our results have yielded new<br>information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceﬂight induces the<br>activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream<br>transcriptional regulatory networks.

As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity (µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when...</p>",

The area of microﬂuidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microﬂuidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantiﬁed by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microﬂuidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantiﬁed worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments.

MscL gates in response to this membrane ten­ sion3 acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4 in response to membrane ten­ sions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5 A crystal structure of MscL from the homolog M. tuberculosis has been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7 (Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now sug­ gests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9 The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for the S. aureus ortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10 further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is...</p>",

Schellberg, a Abigail N. Koppes *abc and Ryan A. Koppes *ab Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs. Introduction Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4 Although significant innovations have been made toward...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the plant shoot apex Margaret E. Wilson1, Matthew Mixdorf1, R. Howard Berg2 and Elizabeth S. Haswell1,* ABSTRACT The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress- induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex. KEY WORDS: Arabidopsis thaliana, Cytokinin, Plastid, Reactive oxygen species, Retrograde signaling, Shoot apical meristem INTRODUCTION The development of land plants provides a unique opportunity to study how cell differentiation is determined, as plant cell identity is highly plastic (Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015).

Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypoco- tyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top...</p>",

Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad ﬂuid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS- 131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) ﬂights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceﬂight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces signiﬁcantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceﬂight relative to control....</p>",

Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simpliﬁed Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these...</p>",

Britt, Department of Plant Biology, University of California at Davis, 1002 Life Sciences, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA e-mail: abbritt@ucdavis.edu Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents....</p>",

Besides its major role as the gateway to the secretory pathway the ER is central to adaptation against abiotic and biotic stress. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on ER dynamics and architecture, the association and interaction of the ER with other organelles as well as its role in stress translation and adaptation (Figure 1). The ER is a dynamic network of membrane tubules and sheets. Movement of the ER along the actin cytoskeleton has a signiﬁ- cant inﬂuence on both its architecture and dynamics. Members of class XI myosin motor proteins have recently been shown to control the movement of the ER and other organelles such as Golgi bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Grifﬁng et al. (2014) explore a subset of class XI myosins with a focus on their role in regulating...</p>",

Javier Medina, Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, E-28040 Madrid, Spain e-mail: fjmedina@cib.csic.es Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses.We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a signiﬁcant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth,...</p>",

TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efﬁcient protein trafﬁcking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid.

This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is inﬂuenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on ﬁlamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two- dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-ﬁxed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A Discovery Environment to Explore Multiple Plant Biology Spaceﬂight Experiments Richard Barker 1, Jonathan Lombardino 1,2, Kai Rasmussen 1 and Simon Gilroy 1* 1 Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States, 2 Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceﬂight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceﬂight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology. botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceﬂight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize...</p>",

Hasenstein* Department of Biology, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, United States Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50◦C and dehydrated fronds up to 65◦C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efﬁciency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40◦C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50◦C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35◦C. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40◦C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated...</p>",

This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environ- ments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various components of the GeneLab plat- form, including the new data repository web inter- face, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non- omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) speciﬁcally designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We...</p>",

The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceﬂight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses inﬂuence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceﬂight-induced deﬁcits in bone and vascular function. Keywords: spaceﬂight; bone; vasculature; oxidative stress; microgravity; hindlimb unloading; radiation; reactive oxygen species; antioxidant 1. The Spaceﬂight Environment and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Health Microgravity and radiation are two unique elements of the spaceﬂight environment that pose challenges to the health of an organism. Microgravity leads to a cephalad ﬂuid shift and profound reductions in mechanical loading of bone and muscle. Spaceﬂight causes perturbations in calcium homeostasis and site-speciﬁc reductions in bone mass (osteopenia),...</p>",

Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals ﬂown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice ﬂown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals ﬂown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceﬂight stimuli? Although there were tissue-speciﬁc changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides,...</p>",

An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a<br>range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development<br>has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies<br>have relied on promoters such as Cauliﬂower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive<br>expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types<br>that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However,<br>few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines<br>expressing GCaMP3 in ﬁve root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis,<br>and trichoblasts. We found similarities and diﬀerences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root<br>cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are<br>known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells.</p>",

Osteoporosis can profoundly aﬀect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell diﬀerentiation from...</p>",

Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A-mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A-mFc on disuse-induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n ¼ 10 each): CON-VEH; CON-mBMPR1A-mFc; HLU-VEH; and HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A-mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2\u0002/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU-VEH group (–5.3% \u0003 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc (–0.3% \u0003 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU-VEH). Leg BMD increased signiﬁcantly more in CON-mBMPR1A-mFc...</p>",

Wallace1,*,‡,§, Gabriel M. Pagnotti2,‡, Jasper Rubin-Sigler3, Matthew Naeher1, Lynn E. Copes4, Stefan Judex2, Clinton T. Rubin2 and Brigitte Demes3 ABSTRACT Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacityof marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femurare more responsive to exercise-induced loadsthan humeral cells, such that running significantly...</p>",

This Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge in land plants and describes their special dependence on cellular water status for growth and development. Understanding how plants cope with water limitation may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes (Long and Ort, 2010). The signaling pathways by which plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these path- ways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 2012). In addition to the importance of osmotic ho- meostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the spe- cific context and language of plant stress biology, and describe what is known (and not known) about the mo- lecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to osmotic challenges. The roles of water in plant biology Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more favorable water conditions. The...</p>",

Schreurs, Akhilesh Kumar, Alana Bartolini, Yasaman Shirazi-Fard, and Ruth K. Globus Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deﬁcits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the inﬂuence of total body irradiation on ex- pression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inﬂammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ‡ 10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-...</p>",

Both cortical and trabecular bone have been includ- ed in muscle-bone correlations but it is unclear which type of bone is more highly associated with muscle strength3-5. Inherently, correlations used in these studies cannot infer causality and, alternatively, may reflect an indirect associa- tion via a shared underlying molecular signal6. Exercise in- duces a highly site-specific mechanical environment in the skeleton7, yet high correlations between muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) span distant sites in the skel- eton8. Thus, an association between muscle and bone may be more global than peak muscle forces...</p>",

This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone<br>shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. Imax/Imin). Individuals with high Imax/Imin<br>values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been<br>more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the<br>shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the<br>model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the ﬁrst<br>experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In<br>the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was<br>removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with lCT.

Abstract Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in...</p>",

Introduction Plants live in a complex and dynamic environment and thus have evolved systems that monitor multiple stimuli and then integrate this information into an appropriate plant-wide response. To accomplish this feat, plants re- quire signaling systems driven by local stimulus perception and response combined with a communication network to broadcast this information throughout the plant body. In this way, responses to even highly localized stimuli, such as an insect chewing on one leaf, can play out in dis- tant tissues. There are numerous chemical signaling mole- cules used to perform this systemic signaling ranging from mobile hormones and peptides to metabolites and RNAs. Additionally, evidence for a parallel informational system built around changes in ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and electrical signaling has begun to emerge. In this update, we will briefly introduce some recent ideas about the multiple, systemic communication pathways...</p>",

First published April 17, 2014; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01174.2013.—Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present signiﬁcant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmem- bers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and expe- rience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceﬂight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day ﬂight on Space...</p>",

First published January 29, 2014; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00371.2013.—Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceﬂight, and casting, causes rapid morpho- logical changes in skeletal muscle: ﬁber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch ﬁbers. An emerging signaling event in response to un- loading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS\u0002) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell- permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOS\u0002 translocation and muscle ﬁber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer- 344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded \u0003 EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK- 134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle ﬁber atrophy...</p>",

Received: 8 February 2014; in revised form: 14 May 2014 / Accepted: 20 May 2014 / Published: 26 May 2014 Abstract: Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis...</p>",

One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated µG on the ground to investigate gravity eﬀects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to µG. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and µG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of...</p>",

The T-DNA insertion is found within exon one of the AT1G05290 gene, however a homozygous T-DNA allele is unattainable. In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia). Further analyses revealed an aber- rant silique phenotype found in the heterozygous SALK_063500 plants that is attributed to the reduced rate of pollen tube ger- mination.

This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceﬂight. Our previous ﬁndings showed that there was a signiﬁcant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceﬂight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufﬁcient to contribute to...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>iScience Review Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceﬂight and to simulated space environments Ara´nzazu Manzano,1,* Euge´ nie Carnero-Diaz,2 Rau´ l Herranz,1 and F. Javier Medina1,3,* SUMMARY Discovering the adaptation mechanisms of plants to the space environment is essential for supporting human space exploration. Transcriptomic analyses allow the identiﬁcation of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceﬂights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceﬂight conditions. European scientists have signiﬁcantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mecha- nisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators. INTRODUCTION Space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efﬁcient way of cultivating plants in space,...</p>",

Kiss,4 F. Javier Medina,1 and Rau´ l Herranz1,6,* SUMMARY Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceﬂight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive pro- cess coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in...</p>",

The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human conﬁnement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inﬂammation but previous analy- ses revealed no common signiﬁcant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identiﬁed 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were signiﬁcantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch...</p>",

Spaceﬂight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA ﬁbers commonly observed with spaceﬂight as these ﬁbers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this ﬁber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-spe-...</p>",

A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 \u0001 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efﬁcacy assay. TAK- 754 (3.1 \u0001 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic hu- man FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 \u0001 1012 and 5.0 \u0001 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution proﬁling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period.

A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 \u0001 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efﬁcacy assay. TAK- 754 (3.1 \u0001 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic hu- man FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 \u0001 1012 and 5.0 \u0001 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution proﬁling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period.

The T-DNA positions are in the 30 UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration- responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and pro- moter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while LOX1 is signiﬁcantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions.

In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and diﬃcult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-speciﬁc micro-CT-based ﬁnite element analysis to measure stiﬀness to prescribe force levels that produce the same speciﬁed level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate...</p>",

Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical A. fu- migatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN- melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from...</p>",

Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) with cryptococcal <br>meningitis are limited. Here, we report for the first time the efficacious and safe use of the ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose <br>of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. We also review the cases of CNS infection caused by C <br>albidus and its related species. Patient concerns: A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical ward with lesions in the intracranial space <br>and accompanying headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and left frontal <br>insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid samples. Diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes: She diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species infection. The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with <br>mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day-1 intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally in 4 <br>divided doses) for 6 weeks.</p>",

Characterization of these draft genomes will allow evaluation of microgravity adaption, risks to human health and spacecraft functioning, and biotechnological appli- cations of fungi. F ungi are potential sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds during long-term spaceﬂight but also could affect astronaut health through both opportunistic infections and system biofouling (1, 2). As part of a study characterizing fungal responses to the space environment, we report the draft genomes of 94 fungal strains that were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), representing 10 ascomycetous and 1 basidiomycetous species.

Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population. PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio- mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS). STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study. SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample.

Materials and methods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD. Results: Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry....</p>",

In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of...</p>",

While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for...</p>",

Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). *Correspondence: rolf@sbpdiscovery.org (R.B. ), kocorr@sbpdiscovery.org (K.O.)....</p>",

Rutkowski1,* 1:Division of Lymphatic Biology, Department of Medical Physiology, Texas A&M University College of Medicine, Bryan, TX, USA 2:Department of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology, Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, College Station, TX, USA Abstract Aim: Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae- mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”? Methods: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1flox/flox; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells. Results: In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated...</p>",

Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation.

CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity...</p>",

We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c- Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an...</p>",

Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle (Krebs & Weitzman et al., 1987), flux in sim-μG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity.

In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life.

Chapes*,1 *Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA †Division of Radiation Research, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA Abstract Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.

In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes. Significance Statement: Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be produced during endoplasmic reticulum stress, the source of ROS...</p>",

Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown...</p>",

David Dickman1 1Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, (St. Louis, MO) 2Department of Neurology, University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) Abstract In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species. Keywords vestibular; sensory convergence; brainstem INTRODUCTION The vestibular system consists of biological sensors that detect head movements in space. The semicircular canals and otolith organs detect angular and linear head accelerations, respectively. In the brainstem, canal and otolith afferents...</p>",

Duran3, and Paul Blount1,* 1Department of Physiology, University of Texas Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA 2Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, current address Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 3Department of Chemistry, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA Abstract MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo- pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors...</p>",

Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2nd or 3rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to...</p>",

Chapesa,* aKansas State University; Division of Biology; Manhattan, KS 66506, USA bKansas State University; Department of Diagnostic Medicine & Pathology; Manhattan, KS 66506, USA Abstract Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick- borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals.

While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested E. coli and S aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure. Keywords mechanosensitive channel; channel kinetics; osmoregulation; protein-lipid interactions Introduction The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels.

The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures.

Delp1 1Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology, and the Center for Exercise Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 2Department of Kinesiology and Applied Physiology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 Abstract Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138...</p>",

The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation.

Objective—The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children. Summary of Background Data—Research in normal children shows that backpack loads compress the lumbar IVDs, increase lumbar coronal deformity, and increase pain. Methods—Fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified.

In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte- specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.

Delp1 1Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology and the Center for Exercise Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 2Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Abstract Introduction—The principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an increase in nitric oxide mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise training. The present study sought to determine whether exercise training improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise. Methods—Six-eight month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) with treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15° incline for 60 min/d over a 10–12 wk period. Sedentary (SED) control animals were acclimated to treadmill exercise for 5 min/d during the week preceding the blood flow measurements. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula were determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m/min walking, 0° incline) using the reference sample microsphere method. Results—The results demonstrate an augmentation of exercise hyperemia above that observed in SED rats during exercise in only one region of bone, the femoral diaphysis of ET rats. However, while exercise hyperemia occurred in 3 of the 9 hindlimb bone regions measured in SED rats, exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 regions in ET rats. Conclusion—These data indicate an increase in generalized hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow during physical activity following a period...</p>",

While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway. The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper intracellular distribution of a wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids. Trafficking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to specific cellular functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, ER-to-Golgi transport represents a vital gateway to the endomembrane system.

While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity- induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls.

We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal...</p>",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro. Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with...</p>",

Haswell Department of Biology, Washington University in Saint Louis, One Brookings Drive, Mail Code 1137, Saint Louis, MO, 63130, USA Abstract The oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes. Keywords Mechanosensitive ion channel; Heterologous expression; Xenopus laevis oocytes; Patch-clamp electrophysiology; Pressure-clamp 1 Introduction Oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) have been used for several decades for the expression of transporters and receptors from bacteria [1], plants [2, 3], and mammals [4–6] due to the simplicity and reliability of this experimental system [7]. Relatively low background ion channel activity [8], large size (1–1.5 mm), low cost, and ease of handling make these cells a favored system for the expression of human, plant and bacterial channels. Xenopus oocytes have also been used as a model system for the study of processes unrelated to ion transport such as apoptosis [9, 10], gene expression [11], the structure and function of the nuclear...</p>",

Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management. Introduction In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates...</p>",

Lawlera,b,* aRedox Biology & Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Health and Kinesiology, College of Education and Human Development, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX bDepartment of Nutrition & Food Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX Abstract Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane...</p>",

Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl)....</p>",

Macias2, Alan R. Hargens2, and Jeffrey C. Lotz1 1University of California, San Francisco, California 2University of California, San Diego, California Abstract Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [2–5]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its successful parasitism of Drosophila [6], but VLP composition and their biotic nature have remained mysterious.

A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment...</p>",

Chapes1 1Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 2Division of Radiation Research, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda University, CA Abstract Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.

Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. METHODS—We analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware during Space Shuttle mission STS-131. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi-array average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error estimation). Glycome profiling was used to analyze cell wall composition in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other groups using the same hardware on the same mission (BRIC-16). KEY RESULTS—In our BRIC-16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls.

Edelmann3, and John Z. Kiss1,4 1Department of Biology, University of Mississippi, University, Oxford, MS 38677, USA 2Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain 3Department of Biology, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA 4Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402, USA Abstract Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response...</p>",

B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These...</p>",

Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically...</p>",

Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceﬂight green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceﬂight and ground control plants were examined post ﬂight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This conﬁrms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceﬂight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceﬂight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Effects of angular frequency during clinorotation on mesenchymal stem cell morphology and migration Carlos Luna1, Alvin G Yew2 and Adam H Hsieh1,3 AIMS: To determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors—as a function of clinorotation speed—using time-lapse microscopy. BACKGROUND: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceﬂight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nulliﬁcation of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). METHODS: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on- chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time- lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients. RESULTS: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (Po0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control (P = 0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting...</p>",

Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~ 40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~ 35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected signiﬁcantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression.

Abstract Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogram- ming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing con- ditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were...</p>",

Brautigam3, Youxing Jiang1,2, Paul Blount1* 1 Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, United States of America, 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, United States of America, 3 Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, United States of America Abstract While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium...</p>",

Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-ﬁlled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-speciﬁc expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile ﬁbers, and gibberellic acid (GA) stimulation of tension wood formation are all...</p>",

The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identiﬁed and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-speciﬁc tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along ﬁlamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi trafﬁc with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways.

In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network- localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain...</p>",

This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and<br>is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in<br>both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5<br>and ARG1 in curving tissue.

Santa Maria 11,12, Camilla Urbaniak13,14, Rik Volger 15, Jiseon Yang 16 & Luis Zea 17 Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Micro- bial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Humanity may be tempted to view the cosmos as a rich reservoir of inﬁnite resources. However, the practical reality of space exploration tells a different story. The need for sustainability in space explora- tion, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful...</p>",

It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress- induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover.

Ricco 12, Jean-Pierre de Vera 16 and Frances Westall17 Space experiments are a technically challenging but a scientiﬁcally important part of astrobiology and astrochemistry research. The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientiﬁc data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientiﬁc community) identiﬁes a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientiﬁc utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well...</p>",

Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafﬁcking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a...</p>",

Lynch4,5 and Camilla Urbaniak 6,7✉ With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like bioﬁlm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufﬁciency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneﬁcial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide...</p>",

We highlight the variety of molec- ular alterations that occur in response to spaceﬂight, most notably changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation. These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across many spaceﬂown species (e.g., mice and as- tronauts), supporting the use of C. elegans as a model organism to study space- ﬂight physiology with translational capital. Integrating tissue-speciﬁc, spatial, and multi-omics approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations, will facilitate the identiﬁcation of candidate regulatory molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research. INTRODUCTION Since Yuri Gagarin ﬁrst traveled to space in 1961, human spaceﬂight activity has grown rapidly. One of the most notable events to date was the 1998 launch of the International Space Station (ISS), a lower Earth or- biting research platform, which allows astronauts to live and work in space for up to a year at a time.1 The microgravity environment of space...</p>",

Recent studies have demon- strated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopa- thology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ- free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c...</p>",

Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-­ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-­ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the...</p>",

Tichy<br>1, Ji-Hyung Lee<br>1, Grant Li1, Katrina N. Estep2, F. Brad Johnson2 and Foteini Mourkioti<br>1,3,4✉<br>Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceﬂight elongates human telomeres<br>in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postﬂight recovery. Astronauts also<br>encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceﬂights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of<br>astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and<br>muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceﬂight mimicking model. We ﬁnd telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem<br>cells and in myoﬁber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model<br>following hindlimb unloading recovery. We ﬁnd that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role<br>for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth. npj Microgravity  (2023) 9:76 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-023-00303-1<br>INTRODUCTION<br>In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded<br>by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in<br>microgravity1.</p>",

Mason 7* & Kasthuri Venkateswaran 1* With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here.

Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceﬂight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth.

ABSTRACT Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehen­ sive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneu­ moniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited...</p>",

Costes 4✉ The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceﬂight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Speciﬁcally, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These ﬁndings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel....</p>",

Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efﬁcacy of bisphosphonates as an anti-sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear. Methods Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microﬂuidic chip device. The ef- fects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP-tagged myoﬁbres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post- adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA-mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life-course. Results We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ±...</p>",

Ferraro1, Ronan K. Carroll2 and Kelly C. Rice 1✉ Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceﬂight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceﬂight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceﬂight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceﬂight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceﬂight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceﬂight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceﬂight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceﬂight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceﬂight experiments Eric S. Land 1, James Sheppard 2, Colleen J. Doherty 2 and Imara Y. Perera 1* 1Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States, 2Department of Molecular and Structural Biochemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, United States Introduction: Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceﬂight experiments have focused on transcriptional proﬁling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difﬁcult to ﬁnd a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceﬂight effects. Methods: Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceﬂight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control. Results and discussion: An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a signiﬁcant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modiﬁcation were commonly downregulated in both...</p>",

The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones inﬂuence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n ¼ 120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks re- covery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days.

Samuel,5 Katja Dierking,2 Andre Franke,6 Matthias Laudes,7 Silvio Waschina,8 Hinrich Schulenburg,2,4 Christoph Kaleta1 AUTHOR AFFILIATIONS See affiliation list on p. 17. ABSTRACT While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and micro­ biota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlap­ ping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predic­ ted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.

Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobac- ter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formida- ble resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug- resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the...</p>",

The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular...</p>",

Broddrick<br>1<br>Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations<br>are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism<br>of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are proliﬁc mediators of<br>bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from<br>bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant<br>(lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are<br>signiﬁcantly different between spaceﬂight strains and their terrestrial coun-<br>terparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could<br>initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These<br>prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence<br>in extreme environments, such as spaceﬂight, to include antimicrobial resis-<br>tance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate<br>microbial adaptation in spaceﬂight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that<br>may impact human health in spaceﬂight. Human space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-<br>duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the<br>emergence of commercial space tourism is redeﬁning the risks asso-<br>ciated with space travel.

Melnick 7, Jaime Mateus8 & Christopher E. Mason 1,2,9 The advent of civilian spaceﬂight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceﬂight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantita- tively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-ﬂight, day of return, and post-ﬂight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceﬂight. We also present the ﬁrst m6A methylation proﬁles for a human space mission, suggesting a signiﬁcant spike in m6A levels immediately post-ﬂight. These data and results represent the ﬁrst longitudinal long-read RNA proﬁles and RNA modiﬁcation maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceﬂight. Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cel- lular systems1–3. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceﬂight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preﬂight...</p>",

Santa Maria13, Egle Cekanaviciute13, Sigrid S. Reinsch13, Hami E. Ray13,14 and Amber M. Paul6,13,15✉ Spaceﬂight and terrestrial spaceﬂight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-speciﬁc effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review highlights current literature on macrophage responses to spaceﬂight and spaceﬂight analogs. npj Microgravity (2024) 10:63 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-023-00293-0 INTRODUCTION Space exploration and habitation will expose crew members to unique risk factors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity forces, social isolation, and enclosed/hostile environments. In addition, these stressors will be experienced at a substantial distance from Earth, where emergency medical intervention will be limited.

Winer 1,2,4,5,19,21 Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single- cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters speciﬁc pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inﬂammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inﬂammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the ﬂavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results deﬁne immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in...</p>",

On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceﬂight healthcare. Alongside the scientiﬁc potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may beneﬁt from international perspectives. Humanity may be on the brink of establishing a new era of inter- planetary space exploration that would witness crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a growing commercial spaceﬂight sector that would prompt a wider health range of individuals entering space compared to the selective cohorts of distinctively ﬁt profes- sional astronauts from previous generations.

Mason 2,11 & Joseph Borg 1 It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of hae- moglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant variations in glo- bin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal character- istics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.

    "summary": "<p>Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49211-2 Single-cell multi-ome and immune proﬁles of the Inspiration4 crew reveal conserved, cell-type, and sex-speciﬁc responses to spaceﬂight A list of authors and their afﬁliations appears at the end of the paper Spaceﬂight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), bio- chemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inﬂammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceﬂight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identiﬁed a “spaceﬂight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We conﬁrmed the presence of this signature in inde- pendent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial tran- scriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health. Human spaceﬂight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, ﬂuid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown signiﬁcant immune stress related to spaceﬂight3. Given that more individuals with diverse phy- sical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn,...</p>",

By proﬁling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/ particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceﬂight secretome proﬁles,” which showed signiﬁcant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-ﬂight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceﬂight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceﬂight can disrupt human and murine physiol- ogy and identify spaceﬂight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development. As spaceﬂight and long-term human missions become more attain- able, minimally invasive approaches to monitor physiological responses to spaceﬂight in diverse populations will be key to pre- venting acute and long-term complications1. The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts2, yet there...</p>",

Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, speciﬁcally between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, space- ﬂight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceﬂight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05213-2 OPEN 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of South Florida...</p>",

Yet the health con- sequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, tran- scriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (his- tology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceﬂight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceﬂight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indi- cate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR. The renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of commercial spaceﬂight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory ‘Deep Space’ missions. The ﬁrst of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars Missions, will for the ﬁrst-time place humans outside of Earth’s protective magnetic ﬁeld exposed to signiﬁcant quantities of...</p>",

These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space ﬂight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artiﬁcial gravity research system during space ﬂight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two...</p>",

However, these alleles have not yet been systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep space missions. Humankind has entered a new chapter of deep space exploration, with numerous institutions worldwide publicly aspiring toward a sustain- able human presence on the Moon and Mars, which is also broadening the diversity of humans in space. In the past two years, the ﬁrst person with a prosthetic leg entered space (Inspiration4), and the ﬁrst person with a physical disability was selected for professional astronaut training by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Braun 1,2 & Val A. Fajardo 1,2 Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause signiﬁcant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-ﬂown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and signiﬁcantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we ﬁnd that spaceﬂight induces signiﬁcant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot...</p>",

ABSTRACT <br>In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable <br>menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first<br>point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes <br>from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin <br>microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of <br>ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with <br>an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. <br>elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify <br>relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying <br>distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including <br>Enterobacter sp. JUb101, are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like <br>Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly <br>found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host <br>cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the <br>well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advan­<br>tages in naturalized contexts.</p>",

Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a ﬁrst line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transforma- tion, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones,...</p>",

Zubair Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into stem cell properties and behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration capabilities. However, there is broader scientiﬁc value to this research including potential translation of stem cell research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important discoveries from different studies performed in space demonstrating the potential use of human stem cells as well as the limitations in cellular therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is required to translate the ﬁndings into clinics. Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advancements in stem cell biology within regenerative medicine as well as innovations in space technologies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been increasingly supportive of academic and commercial groups using micro- gravityfor research and product development with potential beneﬁts foruse on Earth1,2. There is a growing interest in evaluating the potential for stem cells and their derived tissues in space to model human disease mechanisms and treat diseases through cell therapy.

Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration- class missions. With an exponential increase in launches since 2019, space is rapidly becoming more accessible1. Multiple commercial and state-sponsored groups are developing...</p>",

Brereton 24 The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceﬂight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceﬂight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed signiﬁcant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceﬂight pathology and that these interactions might critically inﬂuence human health and long-duration spaceﬂight feasibility.

Benian<br>1<br>UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle<br>function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing<br>UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres<br>and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated<br>with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels,<br>increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria<br>show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be<br>uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an<br>increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to<br>mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1.</p>",

Yamaleyeva 1 Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceﬂight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different inrats ofeithersexfollowing HLU. ThelevelsofG protein-coupled estrogenreceptor (GPER)werelower intheaorta ofSDfemalesexposedto HLUcomparedwith femalecontrolsbutwerenotaltered inmales. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8- hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggestingthat lower GPER may contributeto arterialstiffening in thesettingofsimulated microgravity.

Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down<br>organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects<br>could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and<br>water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups<br>to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat<br>tolerance.</p>",

Abstract Space biology and health data are critical for the success of deep space missions and sustainable human presence off-world. At the core of effectively managing biomedical risks is the commitment to open science principles, which ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoper- able, reusable, reproducible and maximally open. The 2021 integration of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive with GeneLab to establish the NA S A Open Science Data Repository significantly enhanced access to a wide range of life sciences, biomedical-clinical and mission telemetry data alongside existing ‘omics data from GeneLab. This paper describes the new database, its architecture and new data streams supporting diverse dat a t ypes and enhancing dat a submission, retrie v al and analy sis.

    "summary": "<p>Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble James A. Casaletto1, Ryan T. Scott2, Makenna Myrick3, Graham Mackintosh4, Hamed Chok1, Amanda Saravia-Butler2, Adrienne Hoarfrost5, Jonathan M. Galazka6, Lauren M. Sanders6 & Sylvain V. Costes6 Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel. Rodent studies demonstrate that spaceflight negatively impacts liver function1–3. Astronaut studies including the seminal NASA Twins Study also reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation4,5. Despite these findings, there has been relatively little research studying the impact of microgravity or space radiation...</p>",

Astronauts experience dys­<br>regulation of their lymphatic and blood circulatory sys­<br>tems while in space, resulting in a shift of fluids towards <br>the head [5, 6]. Some investigators have also linked both <br>microgravity and the space radiation environment to <br>increased risk for cardiovascular disease [7, 8]. Inflammation is a well-known component of cardiovas­<br>cular disease in ground-based studies [9, 10].</p>",

The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount <br>importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug <br>targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized <br>a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, <br>which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR <br>analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, <br>Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses <br>were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization <br>analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD <br>share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD <br>risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated <br>that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein <br>serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59047-z Mechanosensing antagonizes ethylene signaling to promote root gravitropism in rice Han-Qing Wang 1, Xing-Yu Zhao1, Zhong Tang1, Xin-Yuan Huang 1, Peng Wang 1, Wenhua Zhang 2, Yunhui Zhang3, Sheng Luan 4 & Fang-Jie Zhao 1 Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE- INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2- OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufﬁcient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the...</p>",

Abstract: Blood ﬂow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve<br>muscle strength and size, particularly in load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and<br>hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately<br>and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide<br>spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a<br>high-quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance. Level of Evidence: Level V, expert opinion. R<br>ehabilitation and injury prevention programs are<br>constantly seeking ways to create an environment<br>of progressive overload to produce more resilient,<br>physically prepared individuals. This is particularly true<br>in the athletic population. Athletes are frequently<br>confronted with complicating factors both internal and<br>external that make traditional progressive loading<br>methods<br>problematic<br>or<br>counterproductive. These<br>include underlying concomitant conditions, chronic<br>orthopaedic issues, acute tissue healing timelines, or<br>even previous acute workloads that can create situa-<br>tions where they lack the structural and functional<br>tolerance for an intensiﬁcation in loading during<br>training and rehabilitation.</p>",

Keywords: climate change | evolutionary processes | genetic diversity | host–parasite interactions | MHC ABSTRACT Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individ- uals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our...</p>",

While rapid<br>screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) bioﬁlms are available, there are no methods for such<br>screening of continuous ﬂow bioﬁlms (“ﬂow bioﬁlms”). Since the latter bioﬁlms more closely approximate<br>natural bioﬁlms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe<br>here a new method using a device comprised of microﬂuidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump<br>(BioFlux) that provides ﬂuid ﬂow to 96 individual bioﬁlms. This device allows ﬁne control of continuous or<br>intermittent ﬂuid ﬂow over a broad range of ﬂow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides<br>compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria,<br>staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of ﬂuorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and<br>accurate determination of bioﬁlm viability.</p>",

However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. Methodology and Principal Findings: Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO4?7H2O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4?7H2O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the...</p>",

Nickerson1* 1 School of Life Sciences, Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America, 2 Department of Biology, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States of America Abstract The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non- invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M- like cells, enterocytes, or...</p>",

This system has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings: In terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior (Helix lucorum L.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation (Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures (Helix aspersa L.). Experiments were performed 13–42 hours after return to Earth. Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90u head-down pitch was significantly reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control animals....</p>",

By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiolog- ically relevant, low-ﬂuid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-ﬂuid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent bioﬁlm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteris- tics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray proﬁling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone...</p>",

Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population...</p>",

APEC strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous.

Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-speciﬁc func- tions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-speciﬁc expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity...</p>",

Exposure to 2- g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression.

Melosh, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, and approved November 9, 2012 (received for review June 8, 2012) The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identiﬁed as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (ﬁve isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromati- cum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable...</p>",

Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Failure to Generate Bone Marrow Adipocytes Does Not Protect<br>Mice from Ovariectomy-Induced Osteopenia<br>Urszula T. Iwaniec and Russell T. Turner<br>Skeletal Biology Laboratory, School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State<br>University, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA<br>Abstract<br>A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in<br>ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone<br>growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kitW/W-v) have<br>no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that<br>marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to<br>ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kitW/W-v<br>mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body<br>composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and<br>cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed<br>tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone<br>perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an<br>increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was<br>attenuated in the in kitW/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar<br>vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow<br>adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kitW/W-v mice.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Noroviruses <br>(NoVs) <br>are <br>a <br>leading <br>cause <br>of <br>gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro model for NoV <br>replication remains elusive, making study of the virus <br>difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-<br>D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported <br>NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk <br>virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results <br>showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR <br>of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral <br>structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical <br>analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable <br>presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in <br>NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential <br>cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed <br>3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent <br>with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic <br>features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 <br>model does not support NV replication. N<br>orovirus (NoV) has been identified as the primary <br>etiologic agent of acute epidemic viral gastroenteritis <br>in industrialized countries (1,2). Norwalk virus (NV) is <br>the human prototype GI.1 NoV strain; it belongs to the <br>Caliciviridae family of positive-sense, single-stranded <br>RNA, nonenveloped viruses (3).</p>",

Spores deﬁcient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protec- tion by major \u0002/\u0003-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxiﬁcation via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role.

In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation.

In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca2+-release as well as the expressions of some ﬂg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the...</p>",

We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for Citrobacter,...</p>",

Nickerson1,2 1The Biodesign Institute, Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America 2School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America Abstract Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings...</p>",

MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5- dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Exposure of Bacillus subtilis to Low Pressure (5 Kilopascals) Induces Several Global Regulons, Including Those Involved in the SigB- Mediated General Stress Response Samantha M. Waters, José A. Robles-Martínez,* Wayne L. Nicholson Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Merritt Island, Florida, USA Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below \u00022.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (\u0002101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of \u000220 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, be- longed to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was conﬁrmed by monitor- ing the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure. O n Earth, there are a number of harsh environments that chal- lenge microbial life due to extremes of fundamental physical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, or osmolarity. It is thus of prime...</p>",

In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice....</p>",

C. Matina Department of Microbiology and Immunology,a and Department of Urology,b Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The \u0002s-regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to dis- infectants, but the role of \u0002s in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of \u0002s rendered stationary-phase Esch- erichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the psﬁA genetic reporter, 3=-(p-hydroxyphenyl) ﬂuorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elon- gation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS forma- tion. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufﬁcient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo. Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm.

Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs.

Using mass spectrom- etry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered ex- pression level within 5 min after heat treatment were iden- tified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensi- tive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overex- pressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treat- ment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated in- crease in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2\u0002]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetect- able in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca2\u0002]cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) Is Involved in Vacuole Bulb Formation in Arabidopsis Sang Won Han, Jose M. Alonso, Marcela Rojas-Pierce* Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America * mrojasp@ncsu.edu Abstract Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures in- side vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the pa- rental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to ac- commodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is in- volved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Introduction The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90% of the cell volume. This essential or- ganelle is highly dynamic and has critical...</p>",

We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellular- ized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and en- hanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggre- gates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic sus- pension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could...</p>",

Identification of immune parameters that are dysre- gulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbit- al flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell ac- tivation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Spleno- cyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demon- strated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower ex- pression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage...</p>",

Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the <br>surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, <br>they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides.

Probst2, Parag Vaishampayan1, James R. White3, Deepika Kumar4, Victor G. Stepanov4, George E. Fox4, Henrik R. Nilsson5, Duane L. Pierson6, Jay Perry7 and Kasthuri Venkateswaran1* Abstract Background: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. Results: Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not...</p>",

Shirazi-Fard1, M. Shahnazari1, J. S. Alwood1, T. A. Truong1, C. G. T. Tahimic1, C. L. Limoli2, N. D. Turner3, B. Halloran4 & R. K. Globus1 Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti- inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth. Radiation exposure of skeletal tissues can lead to bone loss and therefore is relevant to astronauts1–9, cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy10–13, radiation workers and victims of nuclear accidents14–16. Reduced bone density (osteopenia) and osteoporosis, are major health conditions affecting millions of people across the world, and osteoporotic...</p>",

Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age- related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector...</p>",

Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose- associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12...</p>",

These baseline sequences will help to understand the observed production of novel bioactive compounds. I n a screening project of natural products, fungal strains isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident (1) have been investigated. The radiation-tolerant microorganisms selected for exposure to micro- gravity at the International Space Station were known to produce valuable natural products; their genomic sequences coded for secondary metabolism pathways; or they displayed positive radiotropism. Aspergillus niger, an industrially important ﬁlamentous fungus, contains a sequence resembling the fumonisin gene cluster, which suggests that the fungus has the genetic potential to produce carcinogenic fumonisins (2). A. niger also produces an abundance of naphtho-gamma-pyrone secondary metabolites, which have been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal (3), antitumor (4), and cytotoxic (3, 4) activity.

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH ARTICLE Transcriptome and proteome responses in RNAlater preserved tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana Colin P. S. Kruse1, Proma Basu1, Darron R. Luesse2, Sarah E. Wyatt1* 1 Department of Environmental and Plant Biology, Ohio University, Athens, OH, United States of America, 2 Department of Biological Sciences, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL, United States of America * (wyatts@ohio.edu) Abstract Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tis- sues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differ- entially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P \u0014 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P \u0014 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments. Introduction For the success of transcriptomic and proteomic experiments sufficient quality and quantity of RNA or protein is essential. The ability to accurately preserve samples prior...</p>",

Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18–23°C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture. Methods—Growing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at either 22 °C or 32°C for up to 18 weeks. Results—C57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Investigation of simulated microgravity effects on Streptococcus mutans physiology and global gene expression Silvia S. Orsini1, April M. Lewis1,2 and Kelly C. Rice1 Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inﬂammation in response to space ﬂight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the speciﬁc physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space ﬂight and/or ground- based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome proﬁles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing bioﬁlm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space ﬂight missions. npj Microgravity (2017) 3:4 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-016-0006-4 INTRODUCTION Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries, demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in humans,1 its ability to...</p>",

    "title": "Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response",
    "summary": "<p>REVIEW ARTICLE OPEN Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response María Moreno-Villanueva1,2, Michael Wong1,3, Tao Lu1,4, Ye Zhang5 and Honglu Wu1 In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Speciﬁcally, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceﬂight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceﬂight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conﬂicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to address this critical question. npj Microgravity (2017) 3:14 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-017-0019-7 INTRODUCTION As humans on...</p>",

Roland1, Karen Brenneman1, Clarence Sams3, Christine Loscher7 and Cheryl A. Nickerson1,8 Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reﬂect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical proﬁling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was conﬁrmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2).

For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceﬂight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceﬂight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceﬂight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types...</p>",

Venkateswaran1* Abstract Background: An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat. Results: Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations.

Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study conﬁrmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water.

    "summary": "<p>Spatial regulation of a common precursor from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity† Chun-Jun Guo,a Wei-Wen Sun,a Kenneth S. Bruno,b Berl R. Oakley,c Nancy P. Kellerd and Clay C. C. Wang*ae In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modiﬁed by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of diﬀerent secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the A. terreus NRPS- like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA, release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in diﬀerent tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own speciﬁc promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the ﬁrst case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue speciﬁc production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with diﬀerent functions. Our data also reveal that a single trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify...</p>",

The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving <br>mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis.

However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous <br>recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR <br>repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged <br>Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the <br>cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the <br>effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute <br>(24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, <br>prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although <br>RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the <br>previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation.</p>",

Singh, Parag Vaishampayan, Kasthuri Venkateswaran Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA ABSTRACT We report here the draft genome of Solibacillus kalamii ISSFR-015, iso- lated from a high-energy particulate arrestance ﬁlter aboard the International Space Station. The draft genome sequence of this strain contains 3,809,180 bp with an es- timated G\u0002C content of 38.61%. S olibacillus is a novel microbial genus characterized in 2009 by Krishnamurthi et al., who reclassiﬁed Bacillus silvestris into the genus Solibacillus, making it the type species (1). The Solibacillus genus was described as comprising Bacillus-like organisms with Gram-positive, rod-shaped cells, and round endospores formed terminally in swollen sporangia. In 2016, Poonam et al. reclassiﬁed Bacillus isronensis into the genus Solibacillus and provided an emended description of the genus Solibacillus that showed the peptidoglycan type to be A4\u0002-L Lys-D-Glu and the fatty acid proﬁle to contain iso-C15:0, C16:1\u00037c alcohol, and iso-C17:1\u00037c, with MK-7 being the major menaquinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine being the major polar lipids (2). Until recently, there were two bacterial species in the genus Solibacillus (S. isronensis and S. silvestris), and draft genomes of both species have been completed (3, 4). In an ongoing microbiological survey from 2014 to 2017, a novel bacterial species was isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance (HEPA) ﬁlter system aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.

Morrison, Patricia Fajardo-Cavazos, Wayne L. Nicholson Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA ABSTRACT Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is al- tered during space ﬂight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space ﬂight mi- crogravity on the International Space Station, termed ﬂight (FL) samples, or at Earth- normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identiﬁed by PM screening as exhibiting signiﬁcant differences (P \u0002 0.05, Student’s t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomeﬂoxacin, man- ganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and triﬂuopera- zine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not re- veal statistically signiﬁcant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space ﬂight. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space ﬂight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space ﬂight environment.

Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice ﬂown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed signiﬁcant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceﬂight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial...</p>",

Branscum, PhD2, Russell T. Turner, PhD1,3, and Urszula T. Iwaniec, PhD1,3 1Skeletal Biology Laboratory, School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA 2Biostatistics Program, School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA 3Center for Healthy Aging Research, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA Abstract Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage...</p>",

The draft genomes of strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA had sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respec- tively. B acillus horneckiae strain 1P01SCT was isolated from a spacecraft assembly clean room at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where the Phoenix spacecraft was assembled (1). As previously reported, spores of this strain were resistant to UV254 radiation up to 1,000 J m\u00022. Bacillus nealsonii FO-92T was isolated from fall-out particles collected from a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2). Spores of FO-92T have exhibited resistances to UV254 up to 300 J m\u00022, and vegetative cells and spores of this organism were resistant in up to 5% liquid H2O2 (2). Acinetobacter radioresistens 50v1 was isolated from the surface of the Mars Odyssey orbiter (3). Vegetative cells of this organism were capable of surviving a combination of stressors, including desiccation, up to 1,000 J of UV254 radiation, and up to 0.33 mg/ml of H2O2 (3).

Cromer, PhD,1 Scott D. Zawieja, PhD,2 Karen M. Doersch, BS,1 Hayden Stagg, MD,3 Felicia Hunter, BS,3,4 Binu Tharakan, PhD,3 Ed Childs, MD,3,4 and David C. Zawieja, PhD1 Abstract It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of ‘‘toxic lymph’’ following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase perme- ability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed signiﬁcantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (*1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that...</p>",

Leehan and Wayne L. Nicholson* Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceﬂight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically signiﬁcant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to RifR was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences...</p>",

We developed a new automated proto- col, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms single-tube ex- tractions while processing at least ﬁve times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identiﬁes 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Labo- ratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n \u0002 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal inten- sive care unit (NICU; n...</p>",

Weitz, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, and approved March 5, 2018 (received for review April 25, 2017) Locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuro- science to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomo- tion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of C. elegans—a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the tra- jectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in...</p>",

T he Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops (1), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans (2, 3). However, F. oxysporum, like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are beneﬁcial to humans (4, 5) and could be exploited for use in the pharmaceutical/ medical industries. During the course of the “Veggie” project (a vegetable production system ﬂown onboard the International Space Station [ISS] to study the effects of the space environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became afﬂicted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2) of these infected plants, and the draft whole-genome sequences are described herein. The whole-genome sequences were paired-end sequenced (2 \u0002 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with...</p>",

F usarium was ﬁrst discovered in 1958, and while notorious for causing the devas- tating disease it causes in plants and crops, it is now recognized as an emerging global opportunistic human pathogen causing numerous cases of fusariosis every year (1, 2). While roughly 80% of the human cases of fusariosis are caused by members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, there are many infections attributed to the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Here, we report the draft whole-genome sequence of F. fujikuroi strain COH1152, which was isolated from a 68-year-old male with refractory acute myeloid leukemia. While undergoing chemo- therapy, he developed a large lesion on his left leg after sustaining minor trauma, followed by neutropenic fever and multiple small painful nodules on his face, abdo- men, and thighs. The biopsy sample of the left thigh skin lesion showed invasive hyphal elements, and a Fusarium sp., as identiﬁed by morphology, was isolated from both blood and tissue cultures.

While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT (6–11). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non- human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were...</p>",

However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains<br>limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid<br>cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the<br>wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P0 worms on agar plates, F1 in liquid cultures, and F2 back on agar plates. Results: Significant variations were found in the gene expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains in response to<br>liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated that 8–34% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses<br>are transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions for genotype, environment, and<br>genotype-environment interactions, we identified that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive<br>responses. Functional analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For example, the<br>N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid<br>cultivation. We found transcript evidence to approximately 21% of the computationally predicted genes in C. elegans<br>by exposing the worms to environmental changes.</p>",

Raikhel, Center for Plant Cell Biology, Riverside, CA, and approved July 19, 2018 (received for review May 16, 2018) The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germi- nation, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known compo- nents of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryo- genesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacu- ole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for ge- netic interactions between...</p>",

Hand4 1Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut, USA 2Department of Craniofacial Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut, USA 3Department of Oral Health and Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut, USA Abstract The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins...</p>",

The SOD1G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the...</p>",

Whole-genome sequencing of the ISS isolate enabled its phylogenetic place- ment within the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade and revealed that the ge- nome of JSC-093350089 is within the observed genetic variance of other sequenced A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of the isolate’s proteome re- vealed signiﬁcant differences in the molecular phenotype of JSC-093350089, includ- ing increased abundance of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, ox- idative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition.

While ﬂat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential fea- tures present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infec- tion, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, com- mensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., ﬂuid shear, stretch, compression). A major chal- lenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accu- rately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the lab- oratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa,...</p>",

Singh1†, Daniela Bezdan2†, Aleksandra Checinska Sielaff1,6, Kevin Wheeler3, Christopher E. Mason2,4,5 and Kasthuri Venkateswaran1* Abstract Background: The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis. Results: Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS...</p>",

Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired<br>leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones<br>inﬂuence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis,<br>DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell<br>from toxins, pathogens, and radiation.</p>",

Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deﬁcient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceﬂight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceﬂight to ground) were identiﬁed within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight. Second, gene expression proﬁles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which deﬁned genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceﬂight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR)...</p>",

Gilbert,c Tamas Torok,d Clay C. C. Wang,e Kasthuri Venkateswarana aJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA bMolecular Plant Pathology, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands cUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA dLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA eUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA ABSTRACT Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured from the dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses us- ing EF-1\u0002 sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically dif- ferent from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant- pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may pro- duce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, in- cluding humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study. IMPORTANCE This is the ﬁrst study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space....</p>",

Stepanov2, Quyen Tran2, Jason M. Wood1, Jeremiah Minich3, Daniel McDonald4, Teresa Mayer1, Rob Knight4,5,6, Fathi Karouia7,8,9, George E. Fox2 and Kasthuri Venkateswaran1* Abstract Background: The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. Results: The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained...</p>",

C. Wang*ab<br>Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them<br>excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce<br>a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis<br>are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant<br>effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced<br>by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of<br>the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules<br>and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome<br>mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus<br>terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM bio-<br>synthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth. 1.

Keune1, Adam J. Branscum2, Carmen P. Wong1, Urszula T. Iwaniec1,3 & Russell T. Turner1,3 Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting. Leptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes, serves...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi MANAS KUMAR TRIPATHY, GAYANI WEERARATNE, GREG CLARK AND STANLEY J. ROUX* Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA SUMMARY A previous study has demonstrated that the treatment of Arabi- dopsis plants with chemical inhibitors of apyrase enzymes increases their sensitivity to herbicides. In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propicona- zole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effec- tive in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fun- gal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide-potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased sig- nificantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13...</p>",

Chlipala2, Fred W. Turek1 and Martha Hotz Vitaterna1* Abstract Background: Space environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. Methods: We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. Results: We report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space- type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Longitudinal time course of muscle impairments during partial weight-bearing in rats Marie Mortreux 1, Frank C. Ko2, Daniela Riveros1, Mary L. Bouxsein2 and Seward B. Rutkove1 In the near future, space agencies plan to send the ﬁrst crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are signiﬁcantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration. npj Microgravity (2019) 5:20 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-019-0080-5 INTRODUCTION By providing a sustained mechanical load, gravity is crucial for the maintenance and health of the musculoskeletal system. Micro- gravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.1–3 For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30% after 3 weeks in microgravity,4 and femoral bone strength declines by ~2% for every 100 days in space.5,6 But the most important consequences lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth and are subjected...</p>",

The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly...</p>",

The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, espe- cially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short- lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to di- verse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle im- provements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and...</p>",

Mednieks2 1Department of Craniofacial Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut, USA 2Department of Oral Health and Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut, USA Abstract Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment. Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space. Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary...</p>",

Speara aDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA ABSTRACT Here, we present 95 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that har- bor antimicrobial resistance genes, isolated from samples obtained in a large ad- vanced wastewater reclamation facility prior to microﬁltration. The MAGs were not in abundance after ﬁltration at the facility and represent a useful resource to the water treatment community at large. H uman society faces an acceleration of water scarcity due to increasing population, pollution, and land use. Such water scarcity also brings a decrease in water quality, as demonstrated by increased eutrophication, among other concerns (1). Treatment and reuse of water are critical tools in combating water stress globally. Reuse of wastewater carries the potential risk of transmission of small-molecule metabolites and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (2), while its use relieves stress on natural sources of water. Previously, bioﬁlms were sampled from the Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced Water Puriﬁcation Facility (AWPF) in Southern California, which showed differences in the microbial communities in both inﬂuent and bioﬁlms on microﬁltration and reverse osmosis membranes (3). In a recent study that more fully characterized both bioﬁlms and large volumes of water throughout the treatment process, we described both microbial diversity and load decreasing across this well- engineered system (4). Here, we have expanded and enhanced this previous work (4) by identifying metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that...</p>",

Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis (CatK, Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts (Col1, Osc). Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation (Mmp3, Mmp13). These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis...</p>",

T. Tahimic2,3, Megan Pendleton4, Ons M’Saad5, Moniece Lowe1,2, Joshua S. Alwood2, Bernard P. Halloran6, Ruth K. Globus2 & Ann-Sofie Schreurs2,7* Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight. Alterations in the gravity vector and exposure to ionizing radiation can disrupt skeletal homeostasis in mice1–3. There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss4–6. Decrements in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in astronauts from the Mir missions as well as missions to the International Space Station (ISS)7–9. While much research has focused on the detrimental effects of microgravity on skeletal tissue, less is known about...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>RESEARCH Open Access The influence of spaceflight on the astronaut salivary microbiome and the search for a microbiome biomarker for viral reactivation Camilla Urbaniak1, Hernan Lorenzi2, James Thissen3, Crystal Jaing3, Brian Crucian4, Clarence Sams4, Duane Pierson4, Kasthuri Venkateswaran1* and Satish Mehta5 Abstract Background: Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post- flight. Results: Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers....</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Dose-dependent skeletal deﬁcits due to varied reductions in mechanical loading in rats Frank C. Ko 1, Marie Mortreux 2,3, Daniela Riveros 3, Janice A. Nagy3, Seward B. Rutkove2,3 and Mary L. Bouxsein1,4✉ Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deﬁcits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional...</p>",

S. Kruse1,2, Alexander D. Meyers1,2, Proma Basu1,2, Sarahann Hutchinson3, Darron R. Luesse3<br>and Sarah E. Wyatt1,2*<br>Abstract<br>Background: Understanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to long-term human habitation in space and<br>can provide new advantages for terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by<br>microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated. Results: Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified<br>protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard<br>the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to<br>isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968<br>RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the<br>proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and<br>simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is<br>a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the<br>splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and<br>SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight.</p>",

The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis<br>elegans and mammals. Speciﬁcally, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO<br>transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial<br>dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of<br>tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual beneﬁts<br>for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneﬁcial eﬀects on aging in C. elegans.</p>",

These genomic se- quences will help in understanding the inﬂuence of microgravity conditions on their potential bioactive compound production and other important characteristics com- pared to their Earth counterparts. S phingomonas species have been isolated from a variety of habitats, and some species possess the unique capability to degrade pollutants (1). Some of the species are known for bioﬁlm formation and eventually corrode the metal surfaces (2), pro- duction of bioactive compounds (3), and plant-pathogenic characteristics (4). Sphin- gomonas paucimobilis has been reported to be associated with infections in immuno- compromised patients (5, 6). In an ongoing microbial observatory experiment, several microbial strains were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) (7). The generation of whole-genome sequences (WGS) to enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS Sphin- gomonas species with their Earth counterparts would lead to the identiﬁcation of the genetic determinants potentially responsible for their important characteristics due to microgravity and elevated radiation conditions.

Further characterization of these sequences will aid in the understanding of the inﬂuence of microgravity conditions on these organisms’ potential pathoge- nicity. I n an ongoing microbial observatory experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), species belonging to the class Tremellomycetes were identiﬁed (1). This class comprises yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and organisms that form hyphae or complex fruiting bodies (2). In this class, the genera Naganishia and Papiliotrema were amended to accommodate the Cryptococcus albidus clade and a few other Cryptococcus species, respectively (3). Among the Cryptococcus species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryp- tococcus gattii are the most common human pathogens; however, recently, there has been an increase in infections caused by non-neoformans Cryptococcus species (4–8). This report presents the draft genome assemblies of four such non-neoformans Cryp- tococcus species, enabling the identiﬁcation of genetic determinants responsible for their potential pathogenicity under the inﬂuence of microgravity compared to their ground controls.

These WGS enable the identiﬁcation of genes responsible for synthesizing compounds with biological implications. R hodotorula mucilaginosa of phylum Basidiomycota is found in soil, air, food, stool, and other environments (1) and produces carotenoids, making it easily identiﬁable by its distinctive pink, yellow, orange, or red colonies (2). Carotenoids are important for various biological activities, including vitamin A biosynthesis, enhancement of the immune system, reduction of the risk of various diseases (3), and protection from radiation (4). For these reasons, R. mucilaginosa carotenoids are used as food additives and hold pharmaceutical potential (5). R. mucilaginosa, which was previously consid- ered to be nonpathogenic, has now been classiﬁed as an emerging pathogen (6, 7) and has been shown to colonize central venous...</p>",

Spaceﬂight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physi-<br>ology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems.

Development of hardware and validation of<br>experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism<br>Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceﬂight-<br>induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceﬂight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a<br>variety of hardware conﬁgurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most<br>recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate ﬂight<br>hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers<br>conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station.

WGS would permit the characterization of these potentially pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the extreme conditions of the space en- vironment. T he order Lactobacillales consists of Gram stain-positive, facultative anaerobes validly described by Ludwig et al. (1). Members of the genus Enterococcus are found to possess human pathogenicity characteristics such as antibiotic resistance (2) and therefore pose health concerns for those on Earth and astronauts residing in the International Space Station (ISS). However, Aerococcus urinaeequi, a nonpathogenic strain, was ﬁrst isolated from horse urine (3). Astronauts on long ﬂights are immuno- compromised due to microgravity-induced physiological and mental stress.

Rumbaugh2, Jerzy Blawzdziewicz3, Nathaniel J. Szewczyk4, Monica Driscoll5 & Siva A. Vanapalli1* In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2,...</p>",

Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be deﬁned. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment.

The whole-genome sequences will aid in comparative genomic studies of ISS Klebsiella strains with Earth counter- parts to gain insight into their adaptation to space conditions. T he genus Klebsiella was discovered by Carl Friedlander in 1882 from the lungs of patients who had died of pneumonia (1). In infected individuals, Klebsiella species can populate the gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, surviving on mucosal surfa- ces, and are known for being highly virulent and resistant to antibiotics (2, 3). When found on Earth, this genus of bacterial pathogens has various degrees of pathogenic- ity, which can lead to severe breathing problems necessitating a ventilator and rapid on-site treatment (4). When exposed to space conditions, however, Klebsiella species might become immunogenic and thus pose a risk to already immunocompromised astronauts aboard the International Space...</p>",

Further analysis of these sequences will enable us to understand their roles for space and biotechnological applications. T he family Bacillaceae is composed of mostly aerobic or facultatively anaerobic rods with a Gram-positive cell wall. Members of this group are ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, and foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures (1). Bacillaceae groups are reported to produce a wide range of valuable and thermostable extracellular enzymes (2). The majority of Bacillaceae can form endospores that are crucial for survival in harsh environments (3, 4). This spore-forming property makes it important for NASA planetary protection pur- poses because spore-forming bacteria are more likely to survive sterilization proce- dures and the harsh environments of outer space, making them a potential threat for forward contamination (5).

Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceﬂight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceﬂights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the ﬁrst model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and...</p>",

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceﬂight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to- lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR proﬁles comparable to spaceﬂight exposed samples.

Sample collection under such difﬁcult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identiﬁed and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preserva- tion method eclipsed those between ﬂight and ground samples, making it difﬁcult to identify spaceﬂight-speciﬁc changes.

This study assessed im- mune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceﬂight con- ditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb un- loaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune proﬁling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceﬂight.

In this hypothesis paper, we: (i) review how eukaryotic cells sense and respond to microgravity using various pathways responsive to unloading of mechanical stress; (ii) we observe that prokary- otic cells possess many structures analogous to mechanosensitive structures in eukaryotes; (iii) we review current evidence indicating that prokaryotes also possess active mechanosensing and mechan- otransduction mechanisms; and (iv) we propose a complete mechanotransduction model including mechanisms by which mechanical signals may be transduced to the gene expression apparatus through alterations in bacterial nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, and epigenetic...</p>",

Szewczyk,2,6 and Monica Driscoll1 SUMMARY Extended space travel is a goal of government space agencies and private com- panies. However, spaceﬂight poses risks to human health, and the effects on the nervous system have to be better characterized. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceﬂight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyper- branching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceﬂight promotes a remarkable accumula- tion of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that spaceﬂight can signiﬁcantly affect adult neuronal morphology...</p>",

We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>BRIEF COMMUNICATION OPEN Evaluating the effect of spaceﬂight on the host–pathogen interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells and Salmonella Typhimurium Jennifer Barrila 1,2, Shameema F. Sarker2, Nicole Hansmeier3,4, Shanshan Yang5, Kristina Buss5, Natalia Briones5,6, Jin Park5, Richard R. Davis1,2, Rebecca J. Forsyth2,16, C.

Wilson12, Naoko Yamazaki13, Jason Steel5, Camila Montano5, Rolf U. Halden14, Tom Cannon9, Sarah L. Castro-Wallace7 and Cheryl A. Nickerson 1,2,15✉ Spaceﬂight uniquely alters the physiology of both human cells and microbial pathogens, stimulating cellular and molecular changes directly relevant to infectious disease. However, the inﬂuence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study ﬂown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceﬂight. To our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst in-ﬂight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells. npj Microgravity (2021) 7:9 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00136-w Humans will travel to space more frequently and for longer duration as the rapidly growing spaceﬂight industry enables more routine access for both professional astronauts and the public. Spaceﬂight can adversely affect multiple aspects of human physiology, including immune and gastrointestinal function1–4. While pre-ﬂight screening and quarantine procedures have reduced infection incidence, astronauts and cargo can still harbor opportunistic and obligate pathogens, including Salmonella spp., which have been recovered from both crew...</p>",

Sng,1 Mingqi Zhou,1 Jordan B. Callaham,1 Robert J. Ferl,1,2 and Anna-Lisa Paul1 Abstract Scientiﬁc access to spaceﬂight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that signiﬁcantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceﬂight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adap- tation to spaceﬂight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome proﬁling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceﬂight adap- tation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome proﬁling was used to gain insight into the spaceﬂight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression proﬁles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to proﬁles from a knock-out line deﬁcient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceﬂight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceﬂight samples were ﬁxed...</p>",

Continued characterization of this closed habitat's micro- biome enables tracking of the spread and evolution of secondary pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health. T he International Space Station (ISS) is currently the only long-term human habitat in space. Microgravity disrupts human immune function (1), and close monitoring of the ISS microbiome for increased pathogenicity is thus an ongoing critical task. Here, we report the draft genomes of 96 bacterial strains that were isolated from the ISS (Table 1). Eleven of the 14 species found are common members of the human microbiome, and most can act as opportunistic human pathogens. Four species from the phylum Actinobacteria were isolated, from the genera Pseudoclavibacter, Kocuria, and Micrococcus, all of which are common in both environmental and human microbiomes (2–5).

The WGS will allow for detailed genomic characterization to determine the possible applications and importance for space and biotechnological industries. D uring an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), 30 strains representing seven species belonging to the Penicillium (n = 5) and Aspergillus (n = 2) genera were isolated (1), and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The Penicillium genus encompasses more than 350 species found world- wide in soil, vegetation, air, indoor environments, and food (2). Aspergillus species are saprophytes found in a variety of environmental niches; however, some of them are also opportunistic human pathogens (3, 4). Members of the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera are of economic and industrial importance, including Penicillium chrysogenum, which is used to produce b-lactam antibiotics (5), Penicillium camemberti, which is used for maturation of soft cheeses such as Camembert, Brie,...</p>",

Willey1,2* Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/ without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed....</p>",

Galazka1 & Xiao Wen Mao7 Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.

The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is...</p>",

Khodadad 2, Anirudha R. Dixit2, Artemis S. Louyakis 3, Gioia D. Massa 4, Kasthuri Venkateswaran 5 and Jamie S. Foster 1✉ Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological beneﬁts. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production. npj Microgravity (2021) 7:22 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x INTRODUCTION As humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned missions to the Moon and cis-lunar orbit, it has become evident that growing plants for food and other life support systems is essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4.

Iwaniec1,2 and Russell T. Turner 1,2✉ Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacriﬁced aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of ﬂight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceﬂight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation. npj Microgravity (2021) 7:23 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00150-y Mice are facultative daily heterotherms and, in contrast to humans who maintain a near constant core body temperature over a wide range of environmental temperatures, mice can experience dramatic transient reductions in core temperature (torpor) when exposed to temperatures below thermoneutral1,2. Because of their small mass, mice are much more dependent on shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis for maintaining core body tempera- ture than larger animals3. The recommended temperature for housing mice in a laboratory setting (20–26 °C) is well below their thermoneutral zone, which depending upon strain, sex and age typically ranges from 29–31 °C4. Subthermoneutral housing induces adaptive responses in mice to increase generation of heat5. These adaptations include shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering ther- mogenesis, thermic effect of increased food consumption and physical activity. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurotrans- mitters (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the adipokine leptin are key factors involved in regulation of adaptive thermogenesis6,7....</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in mechanosensitive tissues Mackenzie L. Hagan1, Vanshika Balayan1, Meghan E. McGee-Lawrence1,2,+ 1Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, 1460 Laney Walker Blvd, CB1101, Augusta, GA 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA Abstract Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic applications are also explored. Keywords mechanotransduction; mechanosensation;...</p>",

McCandless, b Lauren A. Fassero,b Kalein Gates,a Ritesh Tandon b and Paresh Chandra Ray *a Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of speciﬁc COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identiﬁcation, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per...</p>",

Mark Ott3, Olivia King1,2,4, Rebekah Bruce3, Robert J. C. McLean 5 and Cheryl A. Nickerson1,2,6 While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross- sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we proﬁled ﬁve phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and bioﬁlm structure/ composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. npj Bioﬁlms and Microbiomes (2021) 7:70 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41522-021-00240-5 INTRODUCTION Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprece- dented insight into potable water microbiota using culture- independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), reveal- ing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities.

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), which resulted in increased root-growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3-BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3-BIO1 activity. Further- more, cadaverine-treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty...</p>",

Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/ 6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age- matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain ﬁlm at the 12 weeks old. We conﬁrm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERa in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob...</p>",

Cockell1 Received: 2 August 2021 / Accepted: 9 December 2021 / Published online: 6 January 2022 © The Author(s) 2021 Abstract As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.

Author order was determined alphabetically by ﬁrst name. ABSTRACT In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identiﬁed the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identiﬁed 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome- assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its com- parison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS com- parison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp....</p>",

Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the ﬁrst time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the ﬂuorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern−Volmer quenching proﬁle, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modiﬁed Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the eﬀective...</p>",

The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. Methods Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 μg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharma- cokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. Results UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in acti- vated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency...</p>",

The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing micro- fluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Environmental Dependence of Competitive Fitness in Rifampin- Resistant rpoB Mutants of Bacillus subtilis Joss D. Leehan,a Wayne L. Nicholsona aDepartment of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Merritt Island, Florida, USA ABSTRACT RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the ﬂow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis, mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the b-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin re- sistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rifr rpoB mutations have historically been asso- ciated with slower growth and reduced ﬁtness; however, these assessments of ﬁt- ness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reﬂect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advan- tages of speciﬁc rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced ﬁtness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline an- tibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and bioﬁlm-associated infections, may increase...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE Plants grown in Apollo lunar regolith present stress-associated transcriptomes that inform prospects for lunar exploration Anna-Lisa Paul 1✉, Stephen M. Elardo 2 & Robert Ferl 3✉ The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indi- cating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efﬁcient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03334-8 OPEN 1 Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research and Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. 2 Department of Geological Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. 3 UF Research and Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. ✉email: alp@uﬂ.edu; robferl@uﬂ.edu COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:382 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03334-8 | www.nature.com/commsbio 1 1234567890():,; T he return of humans to the Moon during the NASA Artemis program1 has elevated scientiﬁc interest in the lunar...</p>",

The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK...</p>",

Kumar1,2 , Nitin Kumar Singh3 , Sanjaay Balakrishnan2,4 , Ceth W. Parker3 , Karthik Raman1,2,4* and Kasthuri Venkateswaran3* Abstract Background: Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. Results: Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These comple- mentary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Microgravity enhances the phenotype of Arabidopsis zigzag-1 and reduces the Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion in root cells Mengying Wang 1, Katherine Danz1, Vanessa Ly1 and Marcela Rojas-Pierce 1✉ The spaceﬂight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modiﬁcation of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous ﬂights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based ﬁxation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space. npj Microgravity (2022) 8:38 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-022-00226-3 INTRODUCTION Growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and beneﬁt mental health.

The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation.

Beniana aDepartment of Pathology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322 bDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409 cDepartment of Neuroscience, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555 Abstract In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole- animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short- A-bands lying close to the...</p>",

We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>ARTICLE OPEN Microﬂuidics-integrated spaceﬂight hardware for measuring muscle strength of Caenorhabditis elegans on the International Space Station Purushottam Soni1,6, Taslim Anupom2,6, Leila Lesanpezeshki1, Mizanur Rahman1, Jennifer E. Hewitt1, Matthew Vellone3, Louis Stodieck3, Jerzy Blawzdziewicz 4, Nathaniel J. Szewczyk 5 and Siva A. Vanapalli1✉ Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been ﬂown to the International Space Station to investigate the inﬂuence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, speciﬁcally across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microﬂuidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with ﬂow control hardware for spaceﬂight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microﬂuidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a ﬂuid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microﬂuidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microﬂuidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents ﬂuid leakage into...</p>",

Microbiome (2022) 10:210 https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-022-01358-0 RESEARCH Multidrug‑resistant Acinetobacter pittii is adapting to and exhibiting potential succession aboard the International Space Station Braden T. Tierney1†, Nitin K. Singh2†, Anna C. Simpson2, Andrea M. Hujer3,4, Robert A. Bonomo3,4,5,6, Christopher E. Mason1* and Kasthuri Venkateswaran2* Abstract Background: Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an oppor- tunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS. Results: Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii (n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and function- ally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates (n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analy- sis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains. Conclusions: Overall, these results indicated a step forward in...</p>",

These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical conﬁguration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control.

Haswell1 Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130 Edited by Daniel J. Cosgrove, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, and approved October 4, 2012 (received for review August 15, 2012) Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and re- sponding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a num- ber of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mecha- nosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabi- dopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, deﬁni- tive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiol- ogy to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel ac- tivity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was mod- ulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mecha- nosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/ inactivation kinetics, with...</p>",

Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the re- distribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been pro- posed to involve signals ranging from action and system poten- tials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 μm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion chan- nel TPC1.

These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phe- notypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to...</p>",

Schroeder, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, and approved June 18, 2020 (received for review March 6, 2020) One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous el- ements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and fre- quency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bac- terial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the trigger- ing of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic pheno- types. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and related defense responses. The...</p>",

The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 8267; OVX, 6169; OVX+E2, 9064%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.761.6; OVX, 16.360.9; OVX+E2, 25.761.4%).

Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16- week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by mCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross- sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p...</p>",

Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of...</p>",

The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1...</p>",

The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and space- flight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post- euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80˚C.

Anna-Lisa Paul1, Natasha J. Sng1, Agata K. Zupanska1, Aparna Krishnamurthy1, Eric R. Schultz1, Robert J. Ferl1,2* 1 Department of Horticultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America, 2 Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology and Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America * robferl@ufl.edu Abstract Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the funda- mental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome...</p>",

Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) with- out amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene seg- ments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the sim- ilar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V- gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study pres- ents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized anti- body repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.

Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russia * iogneva@yandex.ru Abstract The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of multi- ple cytoskeletal proteins in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice that were euthanized onboard the United States Orbital Segment of the International Space Station 37 days after the start of the SpaceX-4 mission (September 2014, USA). The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were signifi- cant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased. Introduction Under microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. Animal experiments have facilitated the investigation of the struc- tural changes in the myocardium and skeletal muscles that arise during space flights. Previous research has revealed atrophic changes in the skeletal muscles of rats after space flight [1–4]. Moreover, early readaptation...</p>",

Here we use systematic and compre- hensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila can- didates revealed a surprising degree...</p>",

We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosen- sitive...</p>",

Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immu- nocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumi- gatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil- mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10- derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Addition- ally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10- derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic...</p>",

They pro- duce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate...</p>",

ORCID ID: 0000-0003-4856-7690 (C.H.). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass<br>through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar<br>protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and<br>transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on<br>microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the<br>intermediate compartment is absent.</p>",

ORCID IDs: 0000-0001-9597-6839 (S.G.); 0000-0003-3080-2613 (R.J.M.). Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undeﬁned. Here, we use the ﬁre-diffuse-ﬁre model to analyze the behavior of a Ca2+ wave originating from Ca2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that a Ca2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufﬁcient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS-triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca2+ wave...</p>",

It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers...</p>",

The gravitropic response is an often-cited example of biological signal perception, processing (transduc- tion) and response. Signal perception is attributed to sedimenting or moving amyloplasts.1 The physical process is then converted into a biochemical signal that elicits a growth response in the shoot and roots, where differential elongation on the top and bot- tom flank reestablishes the gravitropic set-point angle. The curva- ture is the final step in a series of complex processes2,3 that include redistribution of auxin (the Cholodny-Went hypothesis), differ- ent sensitivities toward auxin and the ability of cells to retain wall plasticity.4 While the detailed analysis of the gravitropic signal process- ing has made significant progress, signal retention or longevity received little attention. The concept of signal persistence inevi- tably leads to the broader issue of defining processes or conditions responsible for the coordination of more than one stimulus and some evaluation of the significance of the stimuli that determine the overall response such as the curvature after gravistimulation. Any type of signal persistence represents some type of memory, which is typically not attributed to organisms such as plants. However, there are numerous examples of memory effects. Perhaps the earliest tests of induced memory were reported as a consequence...</p>",

Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation Cassandra M. Juran,1 Justina Zvirblyte,1,2 and Eduardo A.C. Almeida3 The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceﬂight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5kPa hydrostatic pressure, inﬂuences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the inﬂuence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More speciﬁcally, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and...</p>",

Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity<br>environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading<br>(ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and<br>pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly<br>increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU.

Delp1, Jacqueline M. Charvat2, Charles L. Limoli3, Ruth K. Globus4 & Payal Ghosh1 As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation. The human experience with spaceflight has shown that space...</p>",

Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) residing in bone marrow provide regenerative capacity for bone, replacing and reinforcing the skeleton1. The ability of MSC to respond to mechanical cues generated during functional load- ing is...</p>",

Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceﬂight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohis- tochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse dis- tributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceﬂight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde ﬁxation and mi- crodissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact speci-...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>The Last Mile in Beta-Cell Replacement Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes: Time to Grow Up Lorenzo Piemonti 1,2* 1Unit of Regenerative Medicine and Organ Transplants, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy, 2Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo. However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses signiﬁcant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientiﬁc feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the “last mile” a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.

Although several studies have established that a decrease in protein synthesis and increase in protein degradation lead to muscle atrophy, little is known about the triggers underlying such processes. r A growing body of evidence challenges oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy; furthermore, it is also becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a causative role in determining muscle atrophy. r Mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion have emerged as important processes that govern mitochondrial function and PGC-1α may regulate fusion/ﬁssion events. r Although most studies on mice have focused on the anti-gravitary slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a signiﬁcant loss of mass following unloading. r Here we found that in fast muscles an early...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>The Plant Cell, Vol. 30: 1173–1177, June 2018, www.plantcell.org © 2018 ASPB. Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical pro-<br>jections that expand the effective radius <br>of the root. In doing so, they play crucial <br>roles in the uptake of water and nutrients <br>from the soil, especially under condi-<br>tions in which such resources are limiting <br>(Carminati et al., 2017). Root hairs expand <br>by tip growth, a process that involves <br>the targeted delivery and secretion of <br>vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, <br>root hairs attain lengths that are several <br>times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported <br>by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an <br>assortment of carbohydrate precursors <br>that are needed for the assembly and re-<br>modeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and <br>Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning sev-<br>eral decades has led to the identification <br>of multiple components of the tip growth <br>machinery including protein modulators <br>of cytoskeletal organization, membrane <br>trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) <br>signaling, and phosphoinositide metabo-<br>lism (Cole and Fowler, 2006; Rounds and <br>Bezanilla, 2013). In recent years, plant malectin-like <br>receptor kinases, also known as Catha-<br>ranthus roseus receptor-like kinases <br>(CrRLK1Ls; Franck et al., 2018), have <br>been shown to regulate tip growth in root <br>hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010; <br>Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Ge <br>et al., 2017; Schoenaers et al., 2018).

Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental<br>stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses<br>and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These studies further identiﬁed the RESPIRATORY BURST<br>OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that<br>tissue-speciﬁc expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS<br>signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further<br>demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of<br>Arabidopsis. Taken together, our ﬁndings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of<br>Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration<br>of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles.</p>",

First published June 3, 2010; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00014.2009.—We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity envi- ronments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten- week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggest- ing low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had signiﬁcantly lower muscle mass (\u000123% gastrocnemius wet mass, P \u0002 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology...</p>",

Results: (\u0002)-Pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) three-dimensional structure was obtained at 1.95 Å resolution. Conclusion: The tightly packed trimeric DP has three putative substrate binding sites spatially far apart, suggesting that each site involves monomer coupling directly. Significance: New insights into monolignol radical-radical coupling in planta. Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of diri- gent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((\u0002)-pinoresinol- forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric struc- turewithaneight-stranded\u0003-barreltopologyforeachDPmono- mer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for inter- molecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (\u0002)- or...</p>",

Ganta,b and Stephen K. Chapesa Kansas State University, Division of Biology, Manhattan, Kansas, USA,a and Kansas State University, Department of Diagnostic Medicine and Pathobiology, Manhattan, Kansas, USAb Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hun- dred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult ﬂies that were mutants for several of the “permissive” genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three addi- tional D. melanogaster ﬂy lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten ﬂy lines carrying muta- tions in the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 (Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58), CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Analysis of RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) conﬁrmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant ﬂies compared to wild-type infected control ﬂies. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) en- coded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>The MscS and MscL Families of Mechanosensitive Channels Act as Microbial Emergency Release Valves Ian R. Bootha and Paul Blountb School of Medical Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom,a and Department of Physiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USAb Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life- threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive chan- nels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology under- lying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physio- logical roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function. B acteria are well documented for their ability to survive and grow at extremes of osmolarity. Of particular note are the adaptations to high osmolarity, but these adaptations in them- selves...</p>",
